# Electric Vehicle Population Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing electric vehicle (EV) population data in the United States, particularly exploring trends in the electric range, vehicle types, and manufacturer distributions. The analysis also includes geographical insights and predictive modeling for future EV range.

## Project Overview

The dataset used in this project contains information about the population of electric vehicles registered in the state of Washington, including data on vehicle make, model, MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price), electric range, and more.

### Key Analysis Areas:
1. **Data Exploration**: Understanding the distribution of EVs by year, electric range, and vehicle type.
2. **Geographical Analysis**: Visualizing the distribution of EVs in Washington State using a heatmap.
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Comparing Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) with Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) based on electric range and MSRP.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Building a machine learning model to predict the electric range of top EV models for future years.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for predictive modeling.
- **Folium** & **GeoPandas**: Geospatial analysis and visualization.
